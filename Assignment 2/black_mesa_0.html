				<h2>The Corporation</h2>
				
				<div class="subsection" id="intro">
					
					<img src="./images/logo.png"/>

					<p>Founded in 195X, the Black Mesa Corporation is the largest private research laboratory and the largest military contractor in the United States. Black Mesa's initial mission of exploring <span class="sensitive">high-output nuclear energy</span> led the organization to develop an unparalleled Research Facility and attract an academically diverse team of highly prestigious researchers. Black Mesa's scope widened rapidly to include essentially all scientific and engineering disciplines.</p>

				<div class="subsection" id="fields">

					<p>While Black Mesa has made substantial contributions in the applied sciences (with especially notable influence on the fields of <span class="sensitive">nuclear engineering</span>, robotics, <span class="sensitive">crystallography, nanomaterials</span>, and aerospace engineering), the corporation is perhaps better known for its role as the largest private contributor to the pure sciences. While specific details of Black Mesa's research are highly classified, the research interests of recent scientific hires to the company broadly span antimatter physics, <span class="sensitive">xenobiology</span>, quantum physics, <span class="sensitive">nuclear magnetic resonance</span>, and high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

				<h2>The Research Facility</h2>
				
				<div class="subsection" id="layout">
				
					<img src="./images/tunnel.jpg"/>
				
					<p>The Black Mesa Research Facility spans over <span class="sensitive">52,000 acres</span> in New Mexico. Black Mesa purchased the land from the United States government in 196X, and the decommissioned missile silo which the latter had built on the property still serves as the basis for a small portion of the Research Facility as it exists today. The layout of the Research Facility is not public knowledge, but portions of the facility exist more than <span class="sensitive">two miles</span> underground.</p>
				
				</div>
				
				<div class="subsection" id="energy">
					
					<img src="./images/dam.jpg"/>
					
					<p>Despite the Research Facility's intense electrical demands, it is not connected to any external power grid. Instead, Black Mesa operates the famous "Sector G" hydroelectric dam along with <span class="sensitive">multiple underground nuclear reactors</span>. These state-of-the-art creations were designed in conjunction with the <span class="sensitive">United States Air Force</span>, and largely rely on Black Mesa-developed technologies which have been declared state secrets.</p>

				<h2>The Personnel</h2>
				
				<div class="subsection" id="roles">
				
					<img src="./images/photo.jpg"/>
				
					<p>The bulk of Black Mesa's <span class="sensitive">3500</span> employees are members of the Black Mesa Science Team. Science Team members have terminal degrees in their fields and are world-class experts on their specific areas of research. Given the sensitive nature of Black Mesa's work, several hundred additional employees make up the Black Mesa Security Team. Since all Black Mesa employees must maintain <span class="sensitive">Top Secret security clearance</span>, Security Team positions are often filled by <span class="sensitive">Special Forces veterans</span>. The remainder of Black Mesa's employees serve in maintenance, medical, or administrative roles.</p>
				
				</div>
				
				<div class="subsection" id="family">
				
					<img src="./images/dorms.jpg"/>
				
					<p>Due to the extreme distance between the Black Mesa Research Facility the cities nearest it, spouses and children of Black Mesa employees are invited to live in the Black Mesa Dormitories. Spouses are expected to maintain <span class="sensitive">Confidential security clearance</span>. Non-employees are not permitted to visit the Research Facility except for specific purposes validated by the Security Team no less than four weeks in advance.</p>
